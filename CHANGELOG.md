# üìã Safe Resource Packer - Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-28

### üî• Critical Bug Fixes

**Fixed Infinite Recursion Loop on Startup**
- Fixed circular dependency in `UserProfiler.load_user_profile()` that caused app to hang on startup
- Added recursion guard to prevent `load_user_profile()` ‚Üí `create_initial_profile()` ‚Üí `detect_games()` ‚Üí `load_user_profile()` loop
- App now starts normally without "maximum recursion depth exceeded" errors
- **Impact:** Application was completely unusable, now fully functional

### üìù Documentation Overhaul

**Complete Documentation Audit & Fixes**
- Audited all 28 documentation files for accuracy and consistency
- Fixed 7 critical documentation issues affecting 12 files

**Specific Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Corrected launcher filename references: `Safe_Resource_Packer.bat` ‚Üí `run_safe_resource_packer.bat` (7 files)
- ‚úÖ Fixed compression default value: Changed from incorrect "5" to actual "3" (2 files)
- ‚úÖ Removed non-existent `--batch-repack` CLI flag from documentation (9 files)
- ‚úÖ Clarified batch repacking is Console UI only, not CLI
- ‚úÖ Fixed `process_single_mod_resources()` API signature in docs (removed non-existent parameter, added missing return value)
- ‚úÖ Added missing `--game-path` CLI option documentation

**Terminology Improvements:**
- Changed "mod collection" to "folder containing mods" to avoid confusion with Vortex collections
- Clarified that batch repacker works with folder structures, not Vortex-specific collections

**Nexus Documentation Refinements:**
- Removed all unverifiable performance claims (fake numbers like "3x faster", "95% fewer crashes", "67% space savings")
- Replaced marketing hype with honest, factual descriptions
- Changed tone from "REVOLUTIONARY!" to professional and accurate
- Updated all three Nexus files: BRIEF_DESCRIPTION, DESCRIPTION_BBCODE, and DOCUMENTATION
- Focus now on what the tool actually does, not on unverifiable performance improvements

### üöÄ Features Added

**Game Re-Detection System**
- Added manual game re-detection option to Tools menu
- Users can now re-scan for game installations at any time
- Useful when games are installed/moved after first run
- Shows detected games and automatically saves paths to profile
- Available in both Rich and Basic (non-Rich) modes
- Access: Main Menu ‚Üí 6 (Tools & System) ‚Üí 3 (Re-detect Game Installations)

### üîß Build System Improvements

**Bundled Release Fixes**
- Fixed bundled release not including installed package
- Build script now properly installs `safe_resource_packer` package into bundled Python environment
- Previously only copied source files without installing, causing "No module named safe_resource_packer" error
- Bundled releases now work correctly out of the box

**Version Management Improvements**
- Implemented single-source-of-truth version management
- Version now parsed from `__init__.py` without importing (avoids dependency issues during build)
- Fixed chicken-and-egg problem where setup.py tried to import package before dependencies installed
- Build system and setup.py now use regex parsing to extract version
- Only 2 places to update version: `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`

### ‚úÖ Verifications & Confirmations

**Game Path Persistence**
- Confirmed game paths ARE automatically saved to persistent config
- Saved location: `~/.safe_resource_packer/user_profile.json`
- Includes game names, paths, and detection timestamp
- Cache duration: 7 days (won't re-scan unless forced or expired)

**Guide Chain Consistency**
- Verified all tutorial and guide systems are functional
- Confirmed no circular dependencies in guide chains
- All guides accessible from Tutorial menu (Option 4)
- Guides include: Data Preparation, Results, Troubleshooting, Interactive Tutorial, Comprehension Checks, Example Generator
