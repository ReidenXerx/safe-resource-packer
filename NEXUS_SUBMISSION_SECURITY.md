## 🚨 **Why Antivirus May Flag This (False Positive)**

**Common Triggers:**
- **Bundled Python:** We include Python interpreter (15MB) so users don't need Python installed

- **New Software:** No established reputation yet with antivirus vendors

**What It's NOT:**
- ❌ No network connections (completely offline)
- ❌ No system file modifications  
- ❌ No data collection or tracking
- ❌ No hidden executables or malicious payloads
